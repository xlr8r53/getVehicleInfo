# Deep learning-based license plate recognition system

As part of this project, we intend to create an application with a trained deep learning CNN model using the RTO API. We create a model that can recognize characters on the car's license plate from an image. We then extract the characters and numbers from it, after which we use RTO APIs to get the owner's information. Finally, we develop a Flask Web application to display all this information.

## Use cases:
This type of model can also be used 
•	To identify the stolen vehicles by comparing the cars passing on the roadside with the list of stolen vehicles in the real time and an alert will be generated when a match is found. 
•	Detecting number plate system can be useful in calculating the parking fares by identing the entry and exit timings. 
•	This system also helps in providing the entry access to the authorized personal.

## End users:             
The end users of this project might be:
•	Highway patrol officers or Traffic policemen
•	Security Management of a closed space gateway
•	General public and many more
